# Programming-task
Programming task for LYON Future
The purpose of the task is developing a small service using a technology stack similar to
LYON Future development and deployment platform. Solution can be developed using your
favorite IDE. Share your code with us by using a public repo like github.
Pre requirements
Download XML file from PeppolDirectory - https://directory.peppol.eu/public. This dataset
represents European enterprises and their capabilities to receive electronic invoices by Peppol
infrastructure

Requirements
- Solution has to be built in Java
- Source code must compile
- Use a build script, preferable maven
- Postman collection for testing all of the API methods
- Deployment must be possible in Tomcat or Wildfly (your choice)
- Provide deployment information (how to run it)

Your task is to develop a rest-based HTTP service for doing various queries on the XML
dataset. Solution must be developed in Java8 or 11. You don’t need to think about security.
You can design the architecture as you like

## Task 1: getById
Develop a service (method) for returning one entity from the dataset based on id. Id in the
dataset is the value of the /root/businesscard/participant/@value. Format of the id is
<ICD>:<business number>. E.g value="9908:918039899” means ICD 9908 (which is Norway)
and 918039899 which is the enterprise number for a company called GULENG AS.
Parameters:
Input: 2 parameters ICD and enterprise number
Output: Business card for the enterprise as a JSON.
## Task 2: searchByName
Develop a service (method) for retuning a list of entities from the dataset based on a name
search. The service shall search in the dataset and return a list of matches. “Name” is located
in the dataset at the element /root/businesscard/entity/name/@name. This service must do
a wildcard search for names. E.g. if “CAR” is the input “SUPER CARS”, “CAR WASH” AND
“CARLINGS” will result in a hit.
Parameters:
Input: Name to search for
Output: JSON containing Name, Enterprise number and country code.

## Task 3: getByName
A service similar to getById. This service shall return one business card from the dataset
based on an exact match in the tag /root/businesscard/entity/name/@name
Parameters:
Input: Name to search for
Output: JSON representing the value in one /root/businesscard/.
